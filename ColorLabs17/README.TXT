PROJECT TITLE: Shepard Ferrey
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Assignment
VERSION or DATE: Today
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the file
AUTHORS: Ludo
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Look at the nice pictures I created

1) Dominic - Image looks well balanced, but could be a little brighter.
   Ludo    - Too many details lost. Will edit.
2) Justin  - Brighten up the right side (Blues and black) for better visibility.
   Ludo    - This is the most disturbing image I have ever created. I look sadistic 
   Hayes   - Looks really good!
3) Ben     - Can barely see the difference. Change was too discrete.
   Ludo    - The contrast takes away from the image. I will remove it for the next one.
4) Thomas  - Prefers #2. Likes contrast between the blue and off white in the hair.
   Ludo    - This is nightmare fuel. I will keep it to traumatize my enemies. I hate it.
